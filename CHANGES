19961122 qmail 0.93, gamma.
19961122 change: allowed empty arg list in forward.
19961121 change: qmail-smtpd now uses unknown (like qmail-qmtpd) rather

19961119 change: added 2-minute damper on tcpto.
19961118 change: wrote defaults for readfile controls in showctl.
19961117 change: control_readfile() now allows comments and blank lines.
         tnx LW.
19961117 change: qmail-start sets logger gid to GID_NOFILES.
19961117 bug: ipme_init() uses a fixed-length buffer for SIOCGIFCONF.
         impact: qmail-smtpd and qmail-remote will die if there are too
	 many local IP addresses. tnx MD. fix: ipme_init() now
	 dynamically allocates space, up to 200000 bytes, as long as
	 SIOCGIFCONF keeps failing. note that this is a very widespread
	 bug; it's in amd, exim, mrouted, named, nntpd, rarpd, sendmail,
	 tcpdump, timed, xntpd, and probably dozens more programs.
19961117 portability problem: on BSD 4.4 and various other systems,
         SIOCGIFCONF will truncate long lists and return success.
	 impact: on those systems, qmail-smtpd and qmail-remote will
	 miss some local IP addresses if there are too many. fix:
	 ipme_init() now checks whether there is enough space left in
	 the buffer for another ifreq, plus 64 bytes JIC. yuck.
19961117 change: ipmeprint now flushes only at end.
19961117 cleanup: introduced subfdinsmall. used it in qmail-clean.c,
         qmail-qmtpd.c.
19961117 cleanup: introduced subfdoutsmall. used it in hostname.c,
         printbreak.c, printnumd.c, printsplit.c, qmail-alias.c,
	 qmail-clean.c, qmail-getpw.c, qmail-qmtpd.c, maildir2smtp.c,
	 maildir2qmtp.c.

19961115 change: revamped exit codes everywhere for 0, 100, 111.
19961114 change: added splogger.
19961114 portability problem: Sun's cc recognizes sqrt() as a builtin,
         even if math.h is not included and sqrt is defined statically.
	 yuck. impact: when qmail is compiled with Sun's cc, next-retry
	 times are all screwed up. tnx PJG. fix: my sqrt() is now called
	 squareroot().
19961114 change: dns_ip() now recognizes [1.2.3.4]. tnx DS.
19961112 change: enabled x option in sendmail. tnx DS.
19961111 change: added SIGHUP handling to qmail-send. suggested by many
         people.
19961111 bug: control routines returned incorrect codes for some
         out-of-memory conditions. impact: none; conditions cannot
	 happen with sane control files. fix: return -1.
19961111 change: added SIGALRM handling to qmail-send. suggested by many
         people.

         be updated. suggested by various people.
19961105 change: indicated at various spots in FAQ that qmail has to be
         restarted. suggested by various people.

19961026 qmail 0.92, gamma.
19961026 bug: qmail-getpw did not 0-terminate usernames. tnx CF. impact:

         qmail-lspawn.c.
19961021 portability problem: AT&T NCR boxes need stdio.h before
         arpa/nameser.h. impact: dns.c would not compile. fix: include

19961003 change: added note to maildir2smtp.0 about maildirmake. tnx SM.
19961003 bug: if ipme_init() returned -1, qmail-remote would continue,
         blindly assuming that all addresses are local. impact: on
	 systems with too many aliases, all remote deliveries fail. tnx
	 MD. fix: qmail-remote now dies with temp_oserr() on any result
	 other than 1.
19961003 portability problem: all pre-4.9.4 versions of bind barf,
         badly, on CNAME queries to lame servers. what a crappy system.
	 even if the resolver doesn't barf, the next name server down
	 the line may barf. impact: qmail can't get mail through to
	 domains that are (1) lame and (2) running old versions of bind.
	 fix: never, ever, do a CNAME query. dns_cname() now does an ANY
	 query instead. this, like sendmail's analogous procedure, is
	 unreliable when a CNAME is mixed with other records.
19961001 cleanup: switched to libfd in qmail-start.c.
19960929 cleanup: renamed auto-hasmkffo.h to hasmkffo.h.
19960928 cleanup: reorganized qmail-start.c.

         warning message dedicated to Solaris, if stray newlines show up
	 in the incoming data.
19960926 change: added INSTALL.boot.
19960926 portability problem: on systems that can handle IP interface
         aliases (i.e., on sa_len systems), SIOCGIFADDR returns the
	 primary address for an alias. impact: ipme_init() did not
	 include alias addresses. fix: ipme_init() avoids SIOCGIFADDR on
	 sa_len systems; on these systems, the address we want is
	 already in ifr. tnx DM.
19960926 change: qmail-alias kills itself if locking takes longer than
         30 seconds.
19960926 change: qmail-pop3d no longer moves messages. tnx RS.

         holes, three'' -> ``nine most recent sendmail security holes,
	 four.''
19960920 portability problem: init run commands are subject to job
         control signals under more systems than HP-UX. impact: on some
	 systems (e.g., Solaris), qmail daemons would be killed. fix:
	 INSTALL now tells everybody to use csh -cf.
19960920 change: added queue-run section to FAQ.
19960920 change: in pine-crashing question in FAQ, added -oem and -oi,
         so that change will work with the real sendmail too.
19960919 change: added CNAME section to FAQ. tnx to various people.
19960919 change: eliminated QQX_EXECHARD and QQT_EXECHARD. this means
         that all qmail-queue invocation failures are now soft, even
	 things like EPERM.
19960919 change: replaced ``No such address'' with ``Sorry, no mailbox
         here by that name.'' tnx G2A.

         messages. tnx G2A.

19960916 change: reorganized INSTALL.ids a bit.

19960916 change: added CONF_USERL.
19960916 change: iaafmt() now puts a dot on in-addr.arpa.
19960915 change: added UPGRADE. suggested by several people.
19960915 change: added qsutil error messages to qmail-log.5.
19960915 change: qsutil error messages are now alerts.
19960915 portability problem: on some systems, logger appears to use
         syslog(pri,buf) instead of syslog(pri,"%s",buf). tnx JC.
	 impact: logger could barf or crash if fed messages containing
	 %. an attacker could easily cause a crash, eliminating qmail's
	 logs. fix: % is no longer considered safe for logs.
19960912 cleanup: split seek.c into seek_*.c.

19960831 change: noted in qmail-control.5 that comments are not allowed
         in control files. tnx J2B.

19960825 cleanup: revised ending code in token_addrlist(). 
19960825 change: tokenize now uses linelen 0 for unparse.
19960825 change: if linelen is 0 in token822_unparse, no length limit.
19960825 change: added LINELEN macro to qmail-inject for unparse.
19960825 change: token822_unparse now takes linelen argument. (leaving
         two spaces on the right before linelen.)
19960824 cleanup: renamed token as token822.
19960822 portability problem: under NEWS-OS, /bin/mail and /usr/ucb/mail
         invoke sendmail with -E and -J options. tnx TU. impact:

	 including _optional_ args. ugh.
19960821 change: sendmail now quits if invoked as newaliases. tnx TU.
19960821 portability problem: under NEWS-OS, dirent.h needs sys/types.h.

19960818 change: qmail-pop3d now appends an extra blank line to every

	 would (reliably) die with a bus error; in the Solaris case,
	 maildir2mbox. fix: redefine space in alloc.c to be aligned.

         no-dots-allowed, must-be-nonempty. tnx MD.

19960804 change: reorganized FAQ server instructions into a new section.
19960801 qmail 0.90, gamma.
19960801 change: qmail-qmtpd now supports rcpthosts, RELAYCLIENT.
19960731 change: default NUMD is now 29. this prepares for weird systems
         where getpwnam() needs more than one descriptor (but the
	 descriptor limit is still 64! ... you never know), and for
	 possible future getpwnam() replacements.
19960731 change: popped subfderr buffer up to 32 characters. made sure
         that everybody flushed subfderr as necessary.
19960731 change: maildir2qmtp now prints filenames and responses.
19960731 change: maildir2smtp now prints filenames it's trying and
         relevant portion of SMTP responses.
19960731 change: used succwrite() in maildir2smtp, maildir2qmtp.
         simplifies code quite a bit.
19960731 change: qmail-remote's blast() checks sooner for write errors.
19960731 change: added better -e option to sendmail. tnx TG.
19960731 change: added maildir2qmtp.
19960730 cleanup: eliminated die_nomem() in maildir2smtp.c.
19960730 change: dns_cname now pretends that "foo." is a CNAME for "foo"
	 to give the desired behavior for people who misuse DNS and
	 violate RFC 822. tnx RN.
19960730 change: dns_cname now tests for empty names and ] on every
         loop.
19960730 change: used LSPAWN_BREAK in qmail-send.c for usermap.
19960730 change: updated header example in qmail-header.5.
19960730 change: added printbreak. auto-configured BREAK in dot-qmail.5,
         qmail-lspawn.7, qmail-send.8, qmail-upgrade.7, qlist2.
19960730 change: added printnumd. auto-configured NUMD in qmail-send.8,
         qmail-limits.8.
19960730 change: added printsplit. auto-configured split in qmail-upq.
19960730 change: added dot-qmail.5.
19960730 change: qmail-smtpd now treats HELO as including RSET.
19960730 change: added moreinfo to qlist usage message.
19960729 change: improved an error message in qmail-alias.
19960729 cleanup: merged qmeox(), qmeodx().
19960729 bug: failure to stat .qmail-owner was not an error. impact: if
         stat failed temporarily (e.g., because of NFS), .qmail-owner
	 would be incorrectly ignored, so outgoing message would have
	 wrong envelope sender. fix: qmail-alias does temp_nfsqmail() if
	 stat() returns a temporary error.
19960729 change: added RFCOWNER.
19960729 change: added qmtpd setup question to FAQ.
19960729 change: added qmail-qmtpd.
19960728 change: revamped maildir2smtp error messages.
19960728 change: revamped maildirwatch error messages.
19960728 change: revamped maildir2mbox error messages.
19960728 change: used strerr in maildir_scan().
19960728 change: used strerr in maildir_chdir().
19960728 change: introduced strerr.
19960728 bug: the new tcp-env tried to read from an ndelay socket.
         impact: TCPREMOTEINFO would always be empty. fix: unset ndelay
	 in remoteinfo.c.
19960728 bug: if maildir2smtp saw a permanent failure after MAIL, it
         failed to do RSET. impact: all further messages would be
	 rejected at the MAIL stage. fix: maildir2smtp now always does
	 RSET. tnx JW.
19960728 cleanup: qmail-alias now applies lowercase and dot-to-colon
         conversion directly to dashext, leaving everything else alone.
	 this works since all .qmail access is factored through dashext.
19960727 portability problem: under NeXTStep, -posix is almost entirely
         broken. impact: qmail daemons would dump core under NeXTStep.
	 fix: turn off -posix, except for loading qmail-setup, which
	 needs mkfifo(); NeXT, bless them, didn't put mkfifo() into the
	 C library where it belongs. this requires a new make command,
	 namely loadfifo.
19960727 change: all characters 33-126 are now considered safe for logs.
         tnx MD.
19960727 cleanup: eliminated qp variable from mailforward().
19960727 cleanup: maildirwatch.c includes headerbody.h.
19960727 cleanup: eliminated match from maildirwatch.c.
19960727 cleanup: eliminated code variable from maildir2smtp.c:doit().
19960727 cleanup: maildir2smtp.c includes scan.h.
19960727 cleanup: maildir.c includes str.h.
19960727 cleanup: qmail-popup.c now includes exit.h.
19960727 cleanup: qmail-pop3d.c now includes exit.h.
19960727 cleanup: eliminated path from qmail-start.c.
19960727 cleanup: eliminated birthplusnn from nextretry().
19960727 cleanup: eliminated r from timeoutconn().
19960727 cleanup: tcpto.c now includes byte.h.
19960727 cleanup: spawn.c now declares initialize().
19960727 cleanup: qmail-lspawn.c now includes str.h, byte.h.
19960727 cleanup: qmail-inject.c now includes quote.h.
19960727 change: qmail-check now checks separately for group
         readability and other readability.
19960727 bug: maildir2smtp didn't check flagehlo in PIPELINING parsing.
         impact: a server that said PIPELINING at any point, not just
	 EHLO, would receive pipelined data. fix: check flagehlo.
19960727 bug: readsubdir was calling pause(). impact: if a subdirectory
         was removed, qmail-send would hang. fix: use rs->pause().
19960727 change: used error_str in qmail-qread.
19960727 change: qmail-qread now looks for local/remote open errors.
19960727 cleanup: added warn() in qmail-qread.c.
19960727 change: qmail-qread now exits 111 for temporary errors.
19960727 change: used error_str in qmail-setup.
19960727 change: introduced error_str.
19960727 change: replaced qmail-check with make check in INSTALL.
19960727 change: added check target to Makefile.
19960727 change: replaced qmail-setup with make setup in INSTALL.
19960727 change: indirected fake targets through do- targets.
19960727 change: added setup target to Makefile.
19960727 change: qmail-makectl now makes sure that defaultdomain has
         at least one dot. e.g., enteract.com -> enteract.com, not com.
19960726 bug: quote() failed to quote commas. impact: addresses
         containing commas would not have been quoted correctly for
	 Return-Path or for SMTP MAIL FROM. fix: quote commas.
19960726 change: sendmail now mentions qmail-qread, not qmail-mailq.
19960726 change: qmail-alias now expects ext arg. this eliminates
         LSPAWN_BREAK from qmail-alias and gives lspawn almost complete
	 control over the local -> ~user/.qmail-ext transformation. the
	 exception is that qmail-alias always uses ~user/.qmail,
	 ignoring ext, if local is the same as user.
19960726 change: qmail-lspawn passes ext to qmail-alias.
19960726 change: alloc() now uses up a 4K space before calling malloc().
19960726 change: ipalloc allocation base is now 10. 100 was silly.
19960726 change: stralloc allocation base is now 30.
19960726 change: injectbounce() now supports the owner hack.
19960726 change: qmail-smtpd no longer requires HELO. tnx K1J.
19960726 cleanup: replaced makereceived() with dohelo().
19960726 change: qmail-smtpd is back to 555 for syntax errors.
19960725 change: qmail-alias now supports the owner hack. tnx to RN for
         prodding me to look at this problem.
19960725 change: senderadd() now supports the owner hack.
19960725 cleanup: split off senderadd().
19960725 change: added pine-crashing note to FAQ.
19960725 change: added procmail config.h note to INSTALL.mbox.
19960725 change: added elm TMPDIR note to INSTALL.mbox.
19960725 change: added pine.conf note to INSTALL.mbox.
19960724 change: added fixup note to FAQ.
19960724 change: qmail-inject now exits 111 for temporary errors.
19960724 change: qmail-smtpd now appends RELAYCLIENT to incoming
         recipient domain names.
19960724 cleanup: moved relayclient out of qmail-smtpd's addrallowed()
         into caller.
19960724 change: added rcpthosts wildcards.
19960724 change: added clean target to Makefile.
19960723 change: added virtualdomains exceptions.
19960722 change: added BLURB4.
19960722 change: added BLURB3.
19960722 change: eliminated smarthost and localnet.
19960722 change: incorporated relaymap, contributed by LW. renamed it
         as smtproutes.
19960722 change: qmail-popup now supports APOP. suggested by BG, who
         distributed similar changes.
19960722 change: qmail-popup now sends APOP timestamp to checkpassword.
19960722 cleanup: in qmail-popup, split off doanddie().
19960722 change: qmail-popup now prints APOP timestamp in banner.
19960722 change: added hostname argument to qmail-popup.
19960722 cleanup: in qmail-popup, split out() into out(), outflush().
19960722 cleanup: in qmail-popup, introduced pop3_greet().
19960721 portability problem: under Unisys SVR4, hostname is not in the
         usual path. impact: qmail-makectl fails. fix: added hostname
	 command here, used it in qmail-makectl.
19960721 portability problem: on some sysctl-based systems, apparently
         gethostname() doesn't write anything if the output buffer is
	 too small. it should write a truncated name. impact: if anyone
	 has a hostname longer than 64 characters, maildirs could get up
	 to 64 characters of garbage, rather than a truncated hostname.
	 fix: qmail-alias now does *host = 0 before calling gethostname.
19960721 change: updated FAQ examples from qsmhook to preline.
19960721 change: added preline.
19960721 change: qsmhook now uses signal_init, signal_uninit.
19960721 change: qsmhook now checks specifically for empty args.
19960721 change: documented mbox.
19960721 change: added EXT, EXT2, EXT3, EXT4.
19960721 change: added LAST response to qmail-pop3d, always returning
         OK 0. tnx RN.
19960721 change: added qmail home page to README.
19960721 change: added HELP response to qmail-smtpd. tnx RN.
19960720 change: expanded, vertically, the qmail-inject error message
         for unparseable header fields.
19960720 change: logo is now dolphin. tnx CEJ.
19960719 qmail 0.76, beta.
19960719 change: used LSPAWN_BREAK in qmail-alias for deciding how to
         handle extensions. this should produce better behavior in the
	 (unsupported) case that LSPAWN_BREAK is not a hyphen.
19960719 bug: qmail-smtpd didn't check for null arg on MAIL, RCPT.
         impact: qmail-smtpd would deref 0 and crash. fix: qmail-smtpd
	 now gives syntax error on null arg.
19960719 change: documented UFLINE in qmail-command.8. tnx TG.
19960718 change: added maildir2smtp.
19960718 cleanup: introduced maildir.c. used it in maildir2mbox.c,
         maildirwatch.c.
19960718 change: added maildirwatch.
19960718 cleanup: maildir2mbox now sets up pq2 as it is deleting from
         pq, rather than simultaneously with pq.
19960718 change: added H_DELIVEREDTO.
19960718 portability problem: Unisys requires -lsocket -lnsl. impact:
         couldn't compile under Unisys. fix: added unix_sv section to
	 make-cmds.sh. tnx TVP.
19960718 change: added unix_sv section in find-systype. tnx TVP.
19960717 change: qmail-alias now appends newline if .qmail does not end
         with a newline. tnx MC.
19960717 change: qmail-alias now defers delivery for a blank line only
         if it is the first line of the file. handles user behavior
	 described by MC of putting many newlines at end of file.
19960717 bug: qmail-inject looked for dots in user part, not just host
         part, when deciding whether to use defaultdomain. impact: the
	 address joe.bloggs@here didn't have defaultdomain added. fix:
	 qmail-inject now stops at the @.
19960717 change: updated INSTALL.alias to mention qmsmac.
19960717 change: syntax error code for SMTP is now 501.
19960717 change: added -e option to sendmail. tnx TG.
19960716 change: changed ~alias files to .qmail-local, not .qmaillocal.
	 suggested by many people.

19960716 cleanup: changed todofd to intdfd in qmail-queue.c.
19960716 cleanup: added cleanup() to qmail-queue.c.
19960716 change: added timeout to tcp-env.c, default 30 seconds.
19960716 change: remoteinfo_get() now uses timeoutconn().
19960715 change: added procmail config.h note to FAQ.
19960704 change: qmail-upgrade.7 now warns administrators that ~alias
         generally doesn't apply to addresses starting with a user name.
19960703 change: added echo \c note to FAQ. tnx PJG.
19960702 change: qmail-smtpd now accepts HELO without an argument.
         tnx K1J, J1B.
19960627 change: qmail-lspawn.8 now mentions that qmail-lspawn doesn't
         set up supplementary groups. tnx TG.
19960625 portability problem: under Linux, read(,,0) doesn't do proper
         error slippage. impact: timeoutconn() would always report
	 success; if a connection failed, qmail-remote would report a
	 greeting failure and skip all further MX records. tnx ME. fix:
	 timeoutconn() now uses getpeername() to check for success.
19960625 change: qmail-smtpd now mentions disk full for QQT_WRITE.
19960625 change: qmail-inject now mentions disk full for QQT_WRITE.
19960622 change: if RELAYCLIENT is set, qmail-smtpd skips rcpthosts.
19960609 change: updated INSTALL for current SMTP responses.
19960607 change: clarified INSTALL.qsmhook examples. tnx S1R.
19960607 change: added subject parsing to qlist.c. tnx RN.
19960607 cleanup: used case_diffb in qlist.c.
19960607 change: added extra log information to INSTALL examples.
19960606 change: added -Pn to uucp line in FAQ. tnx DWS.
19960605 portability problem: under Solaris, /usr/bin/groups incorrectly
         reports your groups in /etc/group, rather than the results of
	 getgroups(). tnx MD, PJG. impact: test #19 in INSTALL fails.
	 fix: added special note to test #19 (sigh) about Solaris.
19960605 change: improved maildir setup commands in INSTALL.mbox.
19960605 change: on success, qmail-alias logs forwarding qp. 9 lines
         extra code.
19960605 change: qmail-send logs qp for bounce. 6 lines extra code.
19960605 change: qmail-smtpd includes qp in its response when it accepts
         a message. 7 lines extra code. requested by MD and others.
19960605 change: added qqtalk_qp.
19960605 change: qmail-send now logs uid and qp from todo file. 14 lines
         extra code.
19960605 change: qmail-queue now records uid and qp in u and p lines
         in todo file. 7 lines extra code.
19960605 change: improved qmail-alias x-bit error messages.
19960605 change: newline in log is now converted to /, not underscore.
19960604 change: when it accepts a message, qmail-smtpd includes the
         local time in its 250 response.
19960604 change: on success, qmail-alias prints delivery counts,
         file+forward+program.
19960603 change: qmail-remote now reports IP address on success. tnx MD.
19960603 change: qmail-send now logs success and failure reports, not
         just deferral reports.
19960603 change: added netbsd section in find-systype, same as bsd.os
         section. this will affect netbsd-* systypes. tnx MBS.
19960530 qmail 0.75, beta.
19960528 change: added qmail.7. tnx MD.
19960525 change: added qmail-pop3d. tnx RN.
19960525 change: added qmail-popup. tnx RN.
19960525 change: added elm filter section to FAQ. tnx GB.
19960502 portability problem: on many systems, select() on an
         almost-full pipe incorrectly says writable. tnx ME for running
	 into this and helping track it down. impact: if qmail-send
	 writes a pipeful to qmail-lspawn or qmail-rspawn before they
	 can react (because of high concurrency, high load, or long
	 addresses), it will receive an incorrect -1/EAGAIN, and will
	 conclude that spawn died. sysadmin will have to restart qmail,
	 and messages will be duplicated. fix: in qmail-send.c,
	 busy-loop if write() to spawn returns any error other than
	 EPIPE.
19960501 bug: qmail-alias treated NAMETOOLONG and NOTDIR as temporary
         errors. impact: qmail-alias never looked for -default; even if
	 mail was destined to bounce, it would have to time out first.
	 fix: qmail-alias now uses error_temp().
19960430 bug: qmail-smtpd treated qq crash as permanent error. impact:
         if somebody actively kills qq, mail will be incorrectly
	 bounced. tnx SS. fix: qmail-smtpd now treats only TOOLONG and
	 EXECHARD as permanent errors.
19960430 cleanup: eliminated QQT_TTY from qqtalk.h.
19960428 change: added ``warning: '' before trouble-marking message.
19960428 change: added percenthack. requested by GB.
19960428 cleanup: switched to auto-generated Makefile.
19960428 cleanup: switched to auto-generated .o dependencies.
19960428 cleanup: eliminated fmt.o, scan.o from Makefile.
19960428 portability problem: under HP-UX 10, the rc pgrp is sent HUP
         when rc finishes. tnx BG. impact: the qmail daemons are killed
	 when rc finishes. fix: added special note in INSTALL (sigh) to
	 use csh -cf.
19960427 cleanup: added PORT_SMTP in qmail-remote.c.
19960427 cleanup: introduced timeoutwrite.c. used it in qmail-remote.c.
19960427 cleanup: introduced timeoutread.c. used it in qmail-remote.c.
19960427 cleanup: introduced timeoutconn.c. used it in qmail-remote.c.
19960427 change: added timeoutconnect. default: 60 seconds.
19960427 change: added pop3d instructions to FAQ. tnx RN.
19960427 change: eliminated env manipulation from qmail-start. tnx BG.
19960427 change: headerbody now ends header, inserting blank line, if
         first line of a header field doesn't pass hfield_valid. tnx TG.
19960427 change: headerbody now prepends MBOX-Line: to any header line
         starting From_. this lets qmail-inject work with elm's bounce.
	 tnx OR, K1J, et al.
19960426 change: added moreinfo arg to qlist and qlist2.
19960426 change: added signal_uncatchchild() to qmail-send.c. tnx BG.
         now, if sysadmin sets SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN before invoking
	 qmail-send [sigh], qmail-send won't screw up bounce messages.
19960426 change: dns_cname now checks whether last character is ],
         rather than whether first character is [, for quick return.
19960426 cleanup: glue is now global in dns.c.
19960426 cleanup: qmail-remote no longer does stralloc_0 for host and
         canonhost.
19960426 change: dns_mxip no longer rejects [foo].bar.
19960426 change: dns_mxip no longer requires for bracket that input
         be 0-terminated.
19960426 change: qmail-start can now take logger as an argument.
19960426 change: qmail-start now invokes qmail-send in foreground (as
         parent of other processes).
19960426 change: added mailsubj. tnx GAW.
19960426 portability problem: under some systems, can't lock read-only
         file. impact: maildir2mbox would always fail on those systems.
	 fix: maildir2mbox now opens a separate lock fd. tnx BG.
19960426 cleanup: removed unnecessary #!/bin/sh and # AUTO from mctl.sh.
19960426 change: added qmail-qstat.
19960426 change: added qmail-qread.8.
19960426 change: renamed qmail-mailq as qmail-qread.
19960419 change: qmail-alias now defers delivery rather than skipping
         blank lines in .qmail.
19960419 change: in qmail-lspawn.c, lowercased name before getpwnam().
         really getpwnam() should do this, but oh well.
19960419 change: added username to qmail-lspawn.c, with LSPAWN_USERLEN
         in conf-unusual.h. names longer than LSPAWN_USERLEN will skip
	 getpwnam().
19960419 change: if qlist doesn't see any cmds, it presumes that you
         meant to subscribe.
19960419 change: reorganized qlist acknowledgment format.
19960415 change: reorganized and rewrote FAQ.
19960415 change: renamed HOWTO as FAQ.
19960414 change: in qmail-alias, converted extension to lowercase just
         before qmeopen(), qmeox() calls. thus EXTENSION and USEREXT and
	 RECIPIENT will preserve case passed by qmail-lspawn, while
	 .qmailext lookups will not.
19960414 change: removed case_lowers(r) from qmail-lspawn.c. tnx JLH.
19960414 change: moved extension . -> : conversion to just before
         qmeopen(), qmeox() calls in qmail-alias.c. thus EXTENSION and
	 USEREXT and RECIPIENT will preserve dots.
19960414 change: qsmhook -x now does case-independent comparison.
19960413 change: added procmail instructions to HOWTO.
19960409 bug: qmail-alias does not check for newlines when it generates
         Return-Path. impact: resulting Return-Path header field will be
	 illegal, if sender address contains newline followed by
	 something other than whitespace. fix: qmail-alias now replaces
	 newline with underscore in rpline.
19960409 change: added leaf UUCP description to HOWTO. tnx J2K.
19960409 change: added -B option to sendmail. tnx OR.
19960409 change: qlist now makes lists unwritable (after renaming from
         .qtemp to .qmail). tnx MLH.
19960409 change: added flagdtline to qsmhook.c, based on -l option.
19960409 change: added PIPELINING declaration to qmail-smtpd. tnx JGM.
19960409 change: qmail-smtpd now flushes output instantly after DATA,
         QUIT, HELO, EHLO, NOOP, VRFY, or any 502.
19960409 change: qmail-smtpd now flushes output upon read() and death.
19960409 change: qmail-smtpd no longer flushes output in out().
19960409 change: increased qmail-smtpd outbuf size from 128 to 512.
19960409 cleanup: in qmail-smtpd, eliminated ssinit() in favor of FDBUF.
19960409 bug: qmail-alias produced aliasfoo-owner rather than foo-owner
         as envelope sender for ~alias/.qmailfoo. tnx DS. impact: wrong
	 envelope sender whenever ~alias/.qmailfoo-owner existed. fix:
	 qmail-alias now checks for hyphen at beginning of extension.
19960409 change: added _ESMTP to end of 220. tnx JLH.
19960409 change: moved out("\r\n") out of smtp_greet() into callers.
         this improves the flushing behavior on 221.
19960328 qmail 0.74, beta.
19960326 change: changed subdirectory split from 32 to 23.
19960326 portability problem: some versions of make don't understand
         that a line with just a tab is blank. impact: couldn't compile
	 under those systems. fix: eliminated extra tab from Makefile.
	 tnx TG.
19960325 change: added qmail-mailq.
19960325 change: introduced readsubdir.
19960325 change: qmail-setup makes split; qmail-check checks split.
19960325 change: used split in qmail-send, qmail-clean, qmail-queue
         for mess, info, local, remote.
19960325 change: fmtqfn now supports split queue subdirectories.
19960325 cleanup: eliminated cat2s().
19960325 cleanup: introduced fmtqfn.c. used it in qmail-queue.c,
         qmail-send.c, qmail-clean.c.
19960325 change: in protocol between qmail-clean and qmail-send, now
         using intd/ instead of mess/.
19960325 change: qmail-queue.c and triggerpull.c now work inside queue
         subdirectory.
19960325 change: spawn.c now checks whether message is a regular file.
19960325 change: spawn.c now allows slashes in messid except at
         beginning.
19960325 cleanup: introduced fnmake_split in qmail-send.c.
19960325 cleanup: eliminated strnum in qmail-send.c in favor of
         fnmake_{info,todo,mess,chanaddr} and fnmake2_bounce.
19960325 cleanup: introduced strnum3 in qmail-send.c for the logging
         uses of strnum.
19960325 cleanup: in qmail-send.c, getinfo() now takes id argument.
19960325 cleanup: qmail-send.c now preallocates space for fn, fn2.
19960325 change: time zone is now -0000 instead of +0000. encouraging
         DRUMS to use this as an i-don't-know-the-local-time indicator.
19960324 change: qmail-rspawn.c now calls tcpto_clean().
19960324 cleanup: spawn.c now calls initialize().
19960324 change: qmail-setup makes lock/tcpto; qmail-check checks it.
19960324 change: qmail-remote now quickly skips connect() to a host that
         seems to be down. tnx BP for pressuring me to get this done.
19960323 change: in qmail-alias.8, renamed mboxg as mboxrd. tnx RD.
         idea was popularized by RD in June 1995.
19960322 cleanup: eliminated subfd_init().
19960322 change: qbiff now removes the word Subject.
19960322 change: now /bin/true instead of /dev/null in the generic
         INSTALL.ids instructions. tnx JPR.
19960322 change: added hfield_skipname(). tnx RN.
19960322 bug: qmail-inject did not check whether USER needed quoting.
         impact: if USER had weird characters, the From address would
	 generally be wrong, unless the user manually set up MAILUSER
	 with proper quoting. fix: qmail-inject sets up a quoted-string
	 if necessary.
19960322 cleanup: separated out quote_need() in quote.c.
19960322 cleanup: added stralloc_catb.c. used it in qmail-alias.c,
         qmail-send.c.
19960322 change: qmail-send now uses a quadratic retry schedule from
         birth of each message. this also eliminates clustering.
19960322 cleanup: separated out nextretry() in qmail-send.c.
19960322 change: qmail-remote now passes all non-@ addresses through
         without comment, not just <> and <#>.
19960322 change: replaced # test with anything@[] test in qmail-inject.
19960322 change: replaced # with #@[] in qlist.c, qmail-alias.c,
         qmail-send.c, qreceipt.c.
19960322 change: qmail-lspawn no longer discards messages to <#>.
19960322 cleanup: in qlist, used str_diff for <> and <#> tests.
19960322 change: qmail-alias is now back to testing envelope sender for
         <> and <#>, rather than things without an @.
19960321 change: added 8BITMIME support to qmail-smtpd.
19960321 change: added ESMTP support to qmail-smtpd.
19960318 change: used NEWSENDER in place of SENDER for |forward.
19960318 change: added NEWSENDER.
19960318 change: added HCMSSC support to qmail-alias.c.
19960318 change: added HCMSSC support to spawn.c.
19960318 change: added HCMSSC support to qmail-remote.c.
19960318 change: added HCMSSC support to qmail-smtpd.c.
19960317 portability problem: SCO requires -lsocket -lnsl. impact:
         couldn't compile under SCO. fix: added SCO section in
	 make-cmds.sh. tnx JPR. note that this is for OSR 5; 3.2v4.2
	 will need more fixes, and old 3.2 is basically hopeless.
19960317 bug: newfield_datemake would leave newfield_date alone if it
         was already initialized, even though qmail-send calls
	 newfield_datemake anew for each bounce. impact: bounce messages
	 would usually have an incorrect Date field. fix: redid
	 newfield_datemake to update newfield_date each time.
19960317 change: allowed . and @ in 822 phrases; 822 doesn't allow them,
         but they do show up. tnx to the DRUMS group.
19960317 change: replaced GMT with +0000 in date822fmt.c. this confuses
         a few versions of getdate(), but the DRUMS group is going to
	 outlaw GMT, not just recommend against it as in 1123.
19960317 change: redefined ALIAS_EMPTY to take advantage of . for file
         deliveries. tnx RN.
19960317 change: qmail-alias now allows . as well as / to start file
         deliveries. tnx RN.
19960317 change: qmail-alias now dies (soft) if .qmail is writable to
         others, rather than silently ignoring it.
19960317 change: qmail-alias now dies (soft) if flagforwardonly is
         violated, rather than silently ignoring the bad instructions.
19960317 change: qmail-alias now ignores x bit on empty .qmail files.
19960317 bug: if RCPT gave 4xx and DATA gave 5xx, qmail-rspawn would
         incorrectly assign a permanent failure to that recipient.
	 impact: in that case, mail would be incorrectly bounced. fix:
	 remove orr > 0 test from qmail-rspawn.c.
19960310 change: tcp-env now uses signal_uninit(). [sigh]
19960310 change: tcp-env now specifically unsets HOST and INFO if they
         are not applicable. just trying to make it more widely usable.
19960310 cleanup: used byte_* in remoteinfo.c, ipme.c, tcp-env.c.
19960310 cleanup: added readwrite.h, eliminated sys.h.
19960310 cleanup: included byte.h in qmail-send.c.
19960310 cleanup: eliminated i and j from forward.c's main().
19960310 cleanup: eliminated wstat from qlist.c.
19960310 cleanup: eliminated die_nomem() parameter in qmail-setup.c.
19960310 cleanup: eliminated i from qmail-remote's addrmangle().
19960310 cleanup: added exit.h.
19960310 cleanup: split ipalloc.c off of ip.c.
19960310 cleanup: added fmt_strn.c, eliminated fmt_strncpy.c.
19960310 change: reorganized INSTALL to do some pre-upgrade tests.
         tnx RN.
19960310 change: reordered steps in upgrade procedure in INSTALL.
19960308 change: eliminated ownership test in qmail-alias.c. tnx DS.
19960304 change: in SECURITY, ``six most recent sendmail security
         holes'' -> ``seven most recent sendmail security holes.''
19960303 qmail 0.73, beta.
19960303 change: added SYSDEPS.
19960303 cleanup: revamped select.h autoconfiguration.
19960303 cleanup: revamped fork.h autoconfiguration.
19960303 cleanup: revamped direntry.h autoconfiguration. target is now
         direntry.h; auto-hasdrent.h is gone.
19960303 change: tryflock.c now includes <sys/types.h>, for consistency
         with lock.c. may affect portability.
19960302 portability problem: under BSDI, can't set sticky on normal
         files. dorks. impact: the new qlist doesn't work under BSDI;
         be glad I test things before release. fix: qmail-alias and
         qlist now use executable instead of sticky.
19960302 change: gfrom now quotes >From and >>From etc. as well as From;
         in other words, I'm switching from mbox format to mboxg format.
19960302 cleanup: added gfrom.c. used it in qmail-alias.c, maildir2mbox.c.
19960302 change: addbounce() now substitutes \n\n -> \n/ in reports,
	 and \n -> _ in recips. thus bounces can now be reliably parsed.
19960302 change: if qmail-send had trouble reading the original message
	 or the list of addresses for a bounce, it used to give up and
	 send a bounce with "Oh no! I had trouble reading the rest of
	 your message" or some such. now it aborts the bounce attempt
	 and tries again later.
19960302 cleanup: added qqtalk_fail(). used it in qmail-alias.c,
         qmail-smtpd.c.
19960302 bug: if mailforward() had trouble reading message (e.g.,
         because of an I/O error), it marked an error but kept reading.
	 impact: could loop forever. fix: upon error, break.
19960302 change: maildir2mbox now scans (restrictively) for return-path.
19960302 change: qbiff now prints subject and body, up to 74 chars.
19960302 change: added H_SUBJECT to hfield.
19960302 change: qbiff now puts TO before FROM.
19960301 cleanup: added fmt_str.c. used it in many places.
19960301 change: qmail-send now says something if you've told it to exit
         but it's waiting for some deliveries. tnx RN.
19960301 change: qmail-alias -n now continues (with warning) if home
         directory is sticky. tnx RN.
19960301 change: improved usage messages in qmail-alias.c. tnx RN.
19960301 change: put limit on length of addresses in qlist.
19960301 change: added exit 99 support to qmail-alias. tnx RN.
19960301 change: qmail-alias now exits immediately on temporary or
         permanent error. rewrote section in qmail-alias.8 accordingly.
19960301 cleanup: eliminated flagsuccesses from qmail-alias.c.
19960301 change: added usermap.
19960301 bug: failure to append to mbox was a permanent error. impact:
	 if mbox was temporarily unopenable (e.g., because fds were
	 low), mail would be incorrectly bounced. fix: failure is now
	 temporary. tnx DS.
19960229 change: qmail-alias now preserves any envelope sender that
         doesn't contain an @, not just <> and <#>.
19960229 cleanup: revamped byte_* interface.
19960229 cleanup: renamed str_cpy as str_copy.
19960229 cleanup: added str_chr.c. used it in qbiff.c, qmail-smtpd.c.
19960229 cleanup: added str_rchr.c. used it in qmail-send.c, quote.c,
         qmail-remote.c.
19960229 cleanup: added byte_rchr.c. used it in qmail-smtpd.c, spawn.c.
19960229 cleanup: used USEREXT instead of RECIPIENT in qsmhook.c.
19960229 cleanup: used USEREXT instead of RECIPIENT in qbiff.c.
19960229 cleanup: removed j and k from rewrite() in qmail-send.c.
19960229 portability problem: under HP-UX 10 and Solaris 2.5, can't
         setgroups()/setgid() to the system's nogroup/nobody gid. dorks.
	 impact: inetd chokes, so all SMTP connections are rejected; and
	 ``alias'' mail, including postmaster, bounces. fix: in
	 INSTALL.ids, set up a separate powerless gid (tentatively
	 ``nofiles'') for qmaild and alias. tnx DS and PJG.
19960229 change: qreceipt now uses qqtalk rather than qmail-inject.
19960229 change: qlist now uses qqtalk rather than qmail-inject.
19960229 change: incorporated qmail-setup patch from RN for better
         error messages.
19960228 change: added LSPAWN_BREAK in conf-unusual.h; used it in
         lspawn.c. configurability requested by PJG.
19960228 portability problem: on several systems, including everything
         from DEC, select() on a pipe reader returns 1 if there aren't
	 any writers yet. pointed out by DS. impact: qmail-send chewed
	 up lots of CPU time. fix: trigger_set() now opens the pipe for
	 writing after opening it for reading. also added trynpbg1; on
	 working systems, no point in wasting the extra fd.
19960228 change: qmail-alias uses .qmail sticky bit for forwardonly.
19960228 change: qlist now sets sticky bit on .qmail file.
19960228 change: un-documented +list.
19960228 portability problem: on HP-UX and possibly other systems, the
         supplementary group list does not include the gid. pointed out
	 by DS. impact: on those systems, tryshsgr could incorrectly set
	 hasshsgr; this would prevent qmail-send from running. fix: if
	 tryshsgr sees that getgroups() returns 0, now it actively sets
	 up a supplementary group list. added chkshsgr to make sure the
	 setgroups() will work.
19960227 cleanup: eliminated GETSHORT in dns.c in favor of getshort().
19960227 cleanup: deleted h->len < 3 test from qlist.c:dobody. tnx RN.
19960227 change: replaced ~ with $HOME in INSTALL.mbox.
19960227 change: added note about setgid-mail bits to INSTALL.mbox.
19960227 change: added forward.1.
19960227 change: modified forward to allow multiple addresses.
19960227 change: modified forward to take an entire address, not just a
         hostname.
19960227 change: renamed qrelay as forward.
19960227 change: added USEREXT support to qmail-alias.
19960227 change: added -F to sendmail. the need for this was pointed
         out by RN.
19960227 change: added 2 bytes of slop in alloc().
19960227 bug: received_setup() was not allowing space for the final \0.
         impact: none; the line length is always between 65 and 75
	 characters, which gives at least 45 characters of slop with
	 existing malloc() implementations. fix: leave space. tnx NH.
	 note that the bug here is really in fmt_strncpy, which was
	 written before i was truly free of the curse of libc.a.
19960227 change: added ALIAS_EMPTY in conf-unusual.h; used it in
         qmail-alias.c. tnx PJG.
19960227 change: added SPAWN_NUMD in conf-unusual.h; used it in spawn.c.
19960227 change: added conf-unusual.h.
19960227 cleanup: replaced sizeof(short) with 2 in dns.c.
19960227 portability problem: on an Alpha, long is 64 bits. pointed out
         by DS. impact: address lookups produced incorrect results on an
	 Alpha; qmail-makectl and qmail-remote failed. fix: replaced
	 sizeof(long) with 4 in dns.c.
19960227 portability problem: on an Alpha, bzero() is declared properly
         via sys/time.h. impact: couldn't compile on an Alpha. fix:
	 removed bzero() declaration from select.h. tnx DS.
19960227 portability problem: under SCO, sys/file.h is not protected.
         impact: couldn't compile under SCO. fix: include sys/types.h in
	 lock.c. tnx RN.
19960219 change: added some .qmail-list hints to qlist.1.
19960219 change: added +list support to qmail-alias.
19960215 change: added THANKS.
19960212 bug: foo was not initialized in qrelay.c. impact: depends on
         the machine; on some machines, no effect; on other machines,
	 guaranteed core dump. fix: initialized foo. tnx DS.
19960209 qmail 0.72, beta.
19960209 change: qmail-alias now replaces dot, not slash, with colon.
	 also, qmeopen() makes sure that .qmail file is S_IFREG; I hope
	 this doesn't cause portability problems.
19960209 change: added success-reporting procedure to INSTALL.
19960208 change: added VERSION.
19960208 change: added qlist2.
19960208 change: revamped qlist interface. tnx RN.
19960208 change: improved an error message in qlist.c.
19960208 change: added qrelay. added relay section to HOWTO. tnx DS.
19960208 cleanup: included substdio.h in qqtalk.h.
19960207 bug: prioq_delmin() wasn't guaranteeing heap structure on the
         last element. impact: scheduled passes could have been delayed,
	 conceivably as long as half an hour. fix: prioq_delmin() now
	 checks when it can safely move the last element.
19960207 change: added maildirmake.1, maildir2mbox.1.
19960206 change: revised logo paragraph in THOUGHTS.
19960206 change: replaced nowhere.org with nowhere.mil in examples.
         nowhere.org is a real domain... [sigh]
19960206 change: added qreceipt.1.
19960206 portability problem: IRIX doesn't have vfork. pointed out by
         DS. impact: couldn't compile under IRIX. fix: added fork.h,
	 tryvfork.c.
19960206 portability problem: IRIX doesn't have ranlib. pointed out by
         DS. impact: couldn't compile under IRIX. fix: added IRIX
	 section in make-cmds.sh.
19960205 cleanup: removed warning from substdio_copy() documentation; in
         fact, substdio_copy() can be used safely on a fed substdio.
19960205 change: added qbiff.1.
19960204 change: implemented localnet. removed relevant paragraph from
         THOUGHTS. tnx IS.
19960204 change: in qmail-remote.8, explained the dangers of smarthost.
         tnx IS.
19960204 change: implemented virtualdomains wildcards. tnx JLH.
19960203 change: qmail-send now handles virtualdomains _after_ locals.
         updated INSTALL.qsmhook appropriately.
19960203 change: added note to INSTALL.alias about ~ftp, ~www, ~uucp
         being owned by root.
19960130 cleanup: in qlist.c, renamed flagremoved as flagwasthere.
19960130 bug: qmail-send did not pay attention to flagexitasap in
         pass_dochan(). impact: qmail-send would happily start new
	 deliveries even if it wanted to exit. fix: qmail-send now
	 returns immediately in pass_selprep() and pass_dochan() if
	 flagexitasap.
19960130 change: in qlist.c and qlist.1, renamed ext as list.
19960130 change: in qlist.c and qlist.1, renamed manager as owner.
19960129 qmail 0.71, beta.
19960129 change: mentioned djb-qmailbeta in README. tnx MWE.
19960129 change: added a note to INSTALL.mbox making clear that
         Mailbox is in mbox format. tnx MWE.
19960129 change: qlist now warns you if it didn't see any cmds. tnx RN.
19960129 change: incorporated qlist patch from RN to refuse double subs. 
19960129 change: added qlist.1, contributed by RN. mangled it a bit.
19960129 bug: comment was not allowed in ``phrase (comment) <route>'';
         pointed out by RN. impact: some correct address lists could be
	 mis-parsed by qmail-inject or qlist. fix: token.c now allows
	 TOKEN_COMMENT in the appropriate scan.
19960128 change: added a logo paragraph to THOUGHTS.
19960127 change: implemented rcpthosts.
19960127 change: split up some uses of putflush in qmail-remote,
	 qmail-smtpd, spawn.c. eliminated NODELAY and corresponding
	 paragraph in THOUGHTS.
19960127 change: added quote2(). used it in qmail-alias, qmail-send,
         qreceipt. now addresses are properly quoted in the From, To,
	 and internal Return-Path of bounces; the From and To of
	 receipts; and the Return-Path/RPLINE of delivered messages.
	 removed relevant paragraph from THOUGHTS.
19960127 change: in RFCLOOPS, documented fact that Delivered-To address
         is conventionally not quoted.
19960127 change: knocked default SMTP timeouts down to 20 minutes.
19960127 change: added INSTALL.ids. tnx RN.
19960127 change: in INSTALL, noted that nogroup should already exist.
19960127 bug: pass_selprep checked pqchan[c] even if pass[c].id. impact:
	 qmail-send wasted CPU time whenever more than one message was
	 waiting on a blocked channel. fix: pass_selprep now checks
	 !pass[c].id.
19960127 bug: programs invoked from qmail-alias were immune to SIGPIPE.
         impact: a delivery pipeline such as |yes|head -1000 would loop
	 forever, since yes does not check for write errors. fix: added
	 signal_uninit(). used it before execvp in qmail-alias. [sigh]
19960127 cleanup: added date822fmt.c. used it in newfield.c, qmail-queue.
19960127 cleanup: added fmt_uint0.c. used it in myctime.c, newfield.c,
         qmail-queue.
19960127 cleanup: added dnsdoe.c. used it in dnscname, dnsfq, dnsip,
         dnsmxip, dnsptr.
19960127 cleanup: eliminated temp from dnsfq.c.
19960127 bug: gen_allocdefs was making assumptions incompatible with the
         alloc_re interface. impact: qmail-send would dump core if you
	 ran out of memory. fix: changed alloc_re interface.
19960126 portability problem: some versions of Linux don't have
         net/route.h. pointed out by RN. impact: couldn't compile under
	 those versions. fix: ipme.c no longer includes net/route.h;
	 hopefully this won't cause new portability problems.
19960126 change: added chmod instructions to INSTALL and INSTALL.alias.
         tnx RN.
19960126 change: INSTALL now refers to the traditional sendmail spot
         (/usr/lib), not the BSD 4.4 spot (/usr/sbin). tnx RN.
19960126 change: make auto-uids.h now creates auto-uids.h.tmp first.
	 thus, if someone disobeys the installation instructions, and
	 his make fails to remove targets upon error, he'll still be
	 okay. tnx RN.
19960126 change: added forgeries.7.
19960125 cleanup: eliminated flagverbose, flagmetoo in sendmail.
19960125 cleanup: added substdio_copy.c. used it at several spots.
19960125 cleanup: added constmap.c. qmail-send now uses constmap for
         locals and virtualdomains. this will speed things up: no
	 problem now to have thousands of virtual domains. removed
	 relevant paragraph from THOUGHTS.
19960125 change: added linux section in find-systype. this will affect
         linux-* systypes. tnx RN for relevant info.
19960124 change: added -od, -oe, -p, -f to sendmail. the need for
         these was pointed out by TN.
19960124 bug: qmail-smtpd was reading from descriptor 1. impact: none;
         in normal use, both 0 and 1 point to the network. fix: changed
	 1 to 0.
19960124 bug: qmail-alias treated any .qmail open failure as permanent.
         impact: if a .qmail file was temporarily unopenable (e.g.,
	 because of NFS), it was incorrectly ignored. fix: qmail-alias
	 now dies QLX_SOFT on any open failure other than ENOENT.
19960124 change: added freebsd section in find-systype, same as bsd.os
         section. this will affect freebsd-* systypes.
19960124 cleanup: find-systype now immediately converts sys to lowercase.
19960124 change: qmail-setup now copies man pages into /var/qmail/man;
         qmail-check checks /var/qmail/man. using .0 style, which might
	 cause trouble on various machines, but better than not trying.
19960124 change: in qmail-remote.c, changed perm_control to temp_control
         (and D to Z, thanks); thus failure to read control files (e.g.,
	 because of permissions) is now a temporary error.
19960124 bug: in qmail-remote.c, temp_chdir() used D, not Z. impact: if
         chdir() to CONF_HOME failed (e.g., because of NFS), message
	 would be bounced. fix: changed D to Z.
19960124 change: reorganized README.
19960124 portability problem: Linux has the fifo kernel bug that I had
         hoped I'd never run into. impact: messages under Linux (and any
	 other systems with this bug) were picked up only in sweeps, not
	 instantly. fix: triggerpull.c now writes a byte (non-blocking)
	 to the fifo. updated INTERNALS accordingly.
19960124 bug: in qmail-remote.c, if quit() saw a remote write error, it
         would call writeerr() even though a message report had already
	 been produced. impact: the mess report would include an extra
	 ``ZConnected but communications failed,'' which was confusing
	 to humans. fix: quit() now simply skips the wait-for-QUIT
	 smtpcode() upon write error.
19960124 portability problem: Linux does not have SIGSYS or SIGEMT.
         impact: couldn't compile under Linux. fix: added appropriate
	 ifdefs in signal.c.
19960124 qmail 0.70, beta.
