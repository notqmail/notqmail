SAVE COPIES OF YOUR OUTGOING MAIL! Like any other piece of software (and
information generally), the qmail system comes with NO WARRANTY. It's
much more secure and reliable than sendmail, but that's not saying much.


Things you have to decide before starting:

* The qmail home directory, normally /var/qmail. To change this
directory, edit conf-qmail now.

* The names of the qmail users and the qmail groups. To change these
names, edit conf-users and conf-groups now.


To create /var/qmail and configure qmail (won't interfere with sendmail):

 1. Create the qmail home directory:
       # mkdir /var/qmail

 2. Read INSTALL.ids. You must set up the qmail group and the qmail
    users before compiling the programs.

 3. Compile the programs and create the qmail directory tree:
       # make setup check

 4. Read INSTALL.ctl and FAQ. Minimal survival command:
       # ./config

 5. Read INSTALL.alias. Minimal survival command:
       # (cd ~alias; touch .qmail-postmaster .qmail-mailer-daemon .qmail-root)
       # chmod 644 ~alias/.qmail*

 6. Read INSTALL.mbox and INSTALL.vsm.

 7. Read INSTALL.maildir.

 8. Copy /var/qmail/boot/home (or proc) to /var/qmail/rc.


To test qmail deliveries (won't interfere with sendmail):

 9. Enable deliveries of messages injected into qmail:
       # csh -cf '/var/qmail/rc &'

10. Read TEST.deliver.


To upgrade from sendmail to qmail:

11. Read SENDMAIL. This is what your users will want to know about the
    switch from sendmail to qmail.

12. Read REMOVE.sendmail. You must remove sendmail before installing
    qmail.

13. Read REMOVE.binmail.

14. Add
            csh -cf '/var/qmail/rc &'
    to your boot scripts, so that the qmail daemons are restarted
    whenever your system reboots. Make sure you include the &.

15. Make qmail's ``sendmail'' wrapper available to MUAs:
       # ln -s /var/qmail/bin/sendmail /usr/lib/sendmail
       # ln -s /var/qmail/bin/sendmail /usr/sbin/sendmail
    /usr/sbin might not exist on your system.

16. Set up qmail-smtpd in /etc/inetd.conf (all on one line):
            smtp stream tcp nowait qmaild /var/qmail/bin/tcp-env
            tcp-env /var/qmail/bin/qmail-smtpd

17. Reboot. (Or kill -HUP your inetd and make sure the qmail daemons
    are running.)

18. Read TEST.receive.



That's it! To report success:
       % ( echo 'First M. Last'; cat `cat SYSDEPS` ) | mail djb-qst@cr.yp.to
Replace First M. Last with your name.
