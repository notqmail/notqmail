qmail is a secure, reliable, efficient, simple message transfer agent.
It is meant as a replacement for the entire sendmail-binmail system on
typical Internet-connected UNIX hosts. See BLURB.md, BLURB2.md, BLURB3.md, and
BLURB4.md for more detailed advertisements.

INSTALL.md says how to set up and test qmail. If you're upgrading from a
previous version, read UPGRADE.md instead.

See PIC.* for some "end-to-end" pictures of mail flowing through the
qmail system.

See <https://cr.yp.to/qmail.html> for other qmail-related software
and a pointer to the qmail mailing list.

Other documentation: <https://cr.yp.to/proto.html> shows solutions to
several Internet mail problems; many of these solutions are implemented
in qmail. CHANGES.md and THANKS.md show how qmail has changed since it was
first released. SECURITY.md, INTERNALS.md, and THOUGHTS.md record many of
the qmail design decisions.
