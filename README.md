# notqmail

[notqmail](https://notqmail.org)
is the collaborative Open Source successor to
[qmail](https://cr.yp.to/qmail.html)
and
[netqmail](http://netqmail.org).
It begins with stable, compatible, small releases to which existing
qmail users can safely update, and aims to become a more extensible,
more easily packaged, and more modern Mail Transport Agent suitable
for most needs.

qmail's design principles haven't _always_ prevented bugs or holes,
nor have they _always_ made adding new functionality easy. But
pretty often we get both. And that's why we continue to invest in
this codebase.
