SAVE COPIES OF YOUR OUTGOING MAIL! Like any other piece of software (and
information generally), the qmail system comes with NO WARRANTY. It's
much more secure and reliable than sendmail, but that's not saying much.


Here's how to upgrade to qmail 1.03. This procedure will overwrite the
old qmail binaries. Furthermore, it may begin delivering messages from
the queue before you have had a chance to test it.


WARNING for upgrades from 1.00 or 1.01: qlist has been split into a
separate package. You can obtain it from http://pobox.com/~djb/qlist.html
if you have any users who need it.

WARNING for upgrades from 1.01: recipientmap is gone. The virtualdomains
mechanism has been expanded to support virtual users.


Before starting, compare conf* to your old conf*, and make any necessary
changes. You can copy conf* from 1.02.


How to install:

 1. Compile the programs and create the formatted man pages:
       # make it man

 2. Inform your users that mail will not be accepted for a few minutes.

 3. Disable deliveries by killing your old qmail-send. Wait for it to
    print ``exiting'' in the log.

 4. Disable SMTP service by commenting out the smtp line in inetd.conf;
    kill -HUP your inetd. (If you are using tcpserver, simply kill -STOP
    your tcpserver. If you are running a QMTP server, disable that too.)
    Wait for current qmail-smtpd processes to die.

 5. Install the new binaries and man pages:
       # make setup check

 6. If your boot scripts are using qmail-start instead of /var/qmail/rc:
    Copy /var/qmail/boot/home to /var/qmail/rc. (Use home+df instead if
    you have installed dot-forward; use proc or proc+df if you are using
    procmail by default for local deliveries.) Compare /var/qmail/rc to
    your qmail-start boot line, and edit /var/qmail/rc if necessary.
    Replace your qmail-start boot line with
            csh -cf '/var/qmail/rc &'

 7. Reenable deliveries:
       # csh -cf '/var/qmail/rc &'

 8. Read TEST.deliver.

 9. Reenable SMTP service by restoring the smtp line in inetd.conf; kill
    -HUP your inetd. (If you are using tcpserver, simply kill -CONT your
    tcpserver. If you are running a QMTP server, reenable that too.)

10. Read TEST.receive.


That's it! To report success:
       % ( echo 'First M. Last'; cat `cat SYSDEPS` ) | mail djb-qst@cr.yp.to
Replace First M. Last with your name.
