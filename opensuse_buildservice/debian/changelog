notqmail (1.08-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * CVE-2005-1515: fix signedness wraparound in substdio_{put,bput}().
  * CVE-2005-1514: fix possible signed integer overflow in commands().
  * CVE-2005-1513: fix integer overflow in stralloc_readyplus().
  * Fix several other places where variables could overflow.
  * qmail-pop3d: instead of running as root if root authenticates (and being a vector for a dictionary attack on the root password), exit 1 to look just like a failed checkpassword login.
  * qmail-inject: do not parse header recipients if -a is given.
  * Correctly detect multiple IP addresses on the same interface.
  * Remove workaround for ancient DNS servers that do not properly support CNAME. Patch by Jonathan de Boyne Pollard that was floating around the net for years.

  * Avoid local variables shadowing same-named globals.
  * Avoid needing exit.h in named-pipe bug check.
  * Add a test target and some unit tests, using Check.
  * Add missing function declarations in cdbmss.h, scan.h.
  * Add missing return types to main().
  * Add hier.h for inclusion in instcheck.c, instchown.c, instpackage.c.
  * Use system headers and types instead of the HASSHORTSETGROUPS check.
  * Use system headers instead of redeclaring exit(), read(), write(), malloc(), free(), fork(), uint32_t.
  * Use C89 function signatures for code we've touched so far.
  * TravisCI: move setting MAKEFLAGS out of the script and into the matrix.
  * Add FreeBSD builds with CirrusCi.
  * Add a GitHub Actions build.
  * Remove DJB's TODO.
  * Replace many pobox.com URLs.
  * Acknowledge Erik Sj√∂lund's qmail-local.c bugfix that we've inherited from netqmail.
