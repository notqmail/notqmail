.TH qmail-pop3d 8
.SH NAME
qmail-pop3d \- distribute mail via POP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-pop3d
.I maildirname
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qmail-pop3d
lets a user read and delete his mail through the network.

Mail is stored in a
.B maildir
called
.IR maildirname ,
normally
.BR Maildir ,
in the user's home directory.

.B qmail-pop3d
is normally invoked
under
.BR qmail-popup ,
which reads a username and password,
and
.BR checkpassword ,
which checks the password and sets up environment variables.

Since root will never have a
.B maildir
(because
.B qmail-lspawn
refuses to run
.B qmail-local
as root),
.B qmail-pop3d
also refuses to run as root.
The event will be logged and
.B qmail-pop3d
will exit 1, looking to
.B qmail-popup
like any other failed
.B checkpassword
login.

.B qmail-pop3d
has a 20-minute idle timeout.

.B qmail-pop3d
supports UIDL, TOP, and LAST.

.B qmail-pop3d
appends an extra blank line to every message
to work around serious bugs in certain clients.

.B qmail-pop3d
is based on a program contributed by Russ Nelson.
