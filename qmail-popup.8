with

replaced by the fully qualified domain name of the local host.

.B qmail-popup
expects descriptor 0 to read from the network
and descriptor 1 to write to the network.
It reads a username and password from descriptor 0
in POP's USER-PASS style or APOP style.
It invokes
.IR subprogram ,
with the same descriptors 0 and 1,
and with descriptor 3 reading the username, a 0 byte, the password,
another 0 byte, 
an APOP timestamp derived from
.IR hostname ,
and a final 0 byte.
.B qmail-popup
then waits for
.I subprogram
to finish.
It prints an error message if
.I subprogram
crashes or exits nonzero.

.B qmail-popup
should be used only within
a secure network.
Otherwise an eavesdropper can steal passwords.
Even if you use APOP,
an active attacker can still take over the connection
and wreak havoc.

.B qmail-popup
has a 20-minute idle timeout.

.B qmail-popup
is based on a program contributed by Russ Nelson.
