.SH NAME
qmail-remote \- send mail via SMTP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-remote
.I host
.I sender
.I recip
[
.I recip ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qmail-remote
reads a mail message from its input
and sends the message
to one or more recipients
at a remote host.

The remote host is
.BR qmail-remote 's
first argument,
.IR host .
.B qmail-remote
sends the message to
.IR host ,
or to a mail exchanger for
.I host
listed in the Domain Name System,
via the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).
.I host
can be either a fully-qualified domain name:

.EX
     silverton.berkeley.edu
.EE

or an IP address enclosed in brackets:

.EX
     [128.32.183.163]
.EE

The envelope recipient addresses are listed as
.I recip
arguments to
.BR qmail-remote .
The envelope sender address is listed as
.I sender\fP.

Note that
.B qmail-remote
does not take options
and does not follow the
.B getopt
standard.

.B qmail-rspawn
will invoke the contents of
.B $QMAILREMOTE
instead of
.BR qmail-remote,
if that environment variable is set.

.SH TRANSPARENCY
End-of-file in SMTP is encoded as dot CR LF.
A dot at the beginning of a line is encoded as dot dot.
It is impossible in SMTP to send a message that does not end with a newline.
.B qmail-remote
converts the UNIX newline convention into the SMTP newline convention
by inserting CR before each LF.

It is a violation of the SMTP protocol
to send a message that contains long lines or non-ASCII characters.
However,
.B qmail-remote
will happily send such messages.
It is the user's responsibility to avoid generating illegal messages.
.SH "RESULTS"
.B qmail-remote
prints some number of 
.I recipient reports\fP,
followed by a
.I message report\fR.
Each report is terminated by a 0 byte.
Each report begins with a single letter:
.TP 5
r
Recipient report: acceptance.
.TP 5
h
Recipient report: permanent rejection.
.TP 5
s
Recipient report: temporary rejection.
.TP 5
K
Message report: success.
.I host
has taken responsibility for delivering the message to each
acceptable recipient.
.TP 5
Z
Message report: temporary failure.
.TP 5
D
Message report: permanent failure.
.PP
After this letter comes a human-readable description of
what happened.

.B qmail-remote
may use SMTP Authenticaton of type CRAM-MD4, PLAIN, or LOGIN
(in this order) to connect to remote hosts.
The following reports are provided:
.TP 5
K
no supported AUTH method found, continuing without authentication.
.TP 5
Z
Connected to
.I host
but authentication was rejected (AUTH PLAIN).
.TP 5
Z
Connected to
.I host
but unable to base64encode (plain).
.TP 5
Z
Connected to
.I host
but authentication was rejected (plain)."
.TP 5
Z
Connected to
.I host
but authentication was rejected (AUTH LOGIN).
.TP 5
Z
Connected to
.I host
but unable to base64encode user.
.TP 5
Z
Connected to
.I host
but authentication was rejected (username).
.TP 5
Z
Connected to
.I host
but unable to base64encode pass.
.TP 5
Z
Connected to
.I host
but authentication was rejected (AUTH CRAM-MD5).
Z
Connected to
.I host
but unable to base64decode challenge.
.TP 5
Z
Connected to
.I host
but unable to base64encode username+digest.
.TP 5
Z
Connected to
.I host
but password expired.
.TP 5
Z
Connected to
.I host
but authentication was rejected (username+digest).
.PP
The recipient reports will always be printed in the same order as
.BR qmail-remote 's
.I recip
arguments.
Note that in failure cases there may be fewer
recipient reports
than
.I recip
arguments.

.B qmail-remote
always exits zero.
.SH "CONTROL FILES"
.TP 5
.I authsenders
Authenticated sender.
For each
.I sender
included in
.IR authsenders :
.I sender\fB:\fIrelay\fB:\fIport\fB|\fIuser\fB|\fIpassword
.B qmail-remote
will try SMTP Authentication
of type CRAM-MD5, LOGIN, or PLAIN
with the provided user name
.I user
and password
.I password
(the authentication information)
and eventually relay the
mail through
.I relay
on port
.IR port .
The use of
.I relay
and
.I port
follows the same rules as for
.IR smtproutes
Note: In case
.I sender
is empty,
.B qmail-remote
will try to deliver each outgoing mail
SMTP authenticated. If the authentication
information is missing, the mail is
delivered none-authenticated.
.I authsenders
can be constructed as follows:

.EX
   @example.com|generic|passwd
   .subdomain.example.com|other|otherpw
   mail@example.com|test|testpass
   info@example.com:smtp.example.com:26|other|otherpw
   :mailrelay.example.com:587|e=mc2|testpass
.EE
.TP 5
.I helohost
Current host name,
for use solely in saying hello to the remote SMTP server.
Default:
.IR me ,
if that is supplied;
otherwise
.B qmail-remote
refuses to run.
.TP 5
.I smtproutes
Artificial SMTP routes.
Each route has the form
.IR domain\fB:\fIrelay ,
or
.IR domain\fB:\fIrelay\fB|\fIuser\fB|\fIpassword
in case of authenticated routes without any extra spaces.
If
.I domain
matches
.IR host ,
.B qmail-remote
will connect to
.IR relay ,
as if
.I host
had
.I relay
as its only MX.
(It will also avoid doing any CNAME lookups on
.IR recip .)
.I host
may include a colon and a port number to use instead of the
normal SMTP port, 25:

.EX
   inside.af.mil:firewall.af.mil:26
  :submission.myrelay.com:587|myuserid|mypasswd
.EE

.I relay
may be empty;
this tells
.B qmail-remote
to look up MX records as usual.
.I smtproutes
may include wildcards:

.EX
   .af.mil:
   :heaven.af.mil
.EE

Here
any address ending with
.B .af.mil
(but not
.B af.mil
itself)
is routed by its MX records;
any other address is artificially routed to
.BR heaven.af.mil .

The
.B qmail
system does not protect you if you create an artificial
mail loop between machines.
However,
you are always safe using
.I smtproutes
if you do not accept mail from the network.
Note:
.I authsender
routes have precedence over
.IR smtproutes .
.TP 5
.I timeoutconnect
Number of seconds
.B qmail-remote
will wait for the remote SMTP server to accept a connection.
Default: 60.
The kernel normally imposes a 75-second upper limit.
.TP 5
.I timeoutremote
Number of seconds
.B qmail-remote
will wait for each response from the remote SMTP server.
Default: 1200.
