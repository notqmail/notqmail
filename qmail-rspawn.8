.TH qmail-rspawn 8
.SH NAME
qmail-rspawn \- schedule remote deliveries
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-rspawn
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qmail-rspawn
reads a series of remote delivery commands from descriptor 0,
invokes
.B qmail-remote
to perform the deliveries,
and prints the results to descriptor 1. If the environment variable QMAILREMOTE
is defined, the executable defined by QMAILREMOTE is invoked instead. This can
be set to
.B spawn-filter
which can run the email message through a filter before calling qmail-remote.

.B qmail-rspawn
invokes
.B qmail-remote
asynchronously,
so the results may not be in the same order as the commands.

.B qmail-rspawn
will invoke the contents of
.B $QMAILREMOTE
instead of
.BR qmail-remote,
if that environment variable is set.
